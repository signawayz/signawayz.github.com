      <h1>Do Away with Paper Sign In Sheets</h1>
      <p class="date"> March 9, 2014 </p>  
      <p>I am still amazed by how often I come across paper sign in sheets.  I can’t even count the number of times I have had to scribble down my name when I show up at a class, meeting, or event.  The continued use of this archaic process is confusing, especially given the proliferation of mobile phones, tablets, and constant connectivity.</p>

      <p>My frustration with paper sign ins reached a high point when I started school at MIT.  To be fair, my expectations for the school’s technical sophistication were a bit unfair. But it is MIT, right?  I was amazed to see classes and clubs on campus using paper sign-in sheets.  The more advanced groups utilized Google Forms or spreadsheets, but these were still clearly inefficient.  In fact, I spent 20 minutes of an hour long club meeting waiting in line to pay club dues and add my name to a Google Doc.  I left that meeting with a negative impression of the group and never returned.  </p>

      <p>Most classrooms also utilize the paper sign in sheet.  Its a constant source of distraction for myself and those around me.  Where do I pass this next?  Wait did the left side of the room get it yet?  Should I pass it back to the TA?  On a few occasions the sign in sheet skips entire rows or sections of students.  Some recognize it and track down the Teaching Assistant.  Others don’t even notice and their attendance grades take a hit.</p>

      <p>I know I am not alone in these frustrations as it is a commonly voiced concern amongst my classmates.  It is clear that no one has developed a better solution.  So why not give it a shot?  That is our motivation behind SignAwayz.</p>
