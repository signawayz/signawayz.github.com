      <h1>3 Keys to Group Management</h1>
      <p class="date"> March 10, 2014 </p>  
      <p>Group management is a PAIN…administrative tasks distract focus from the group’s mission.</p>
      <p>To avoid group destruction due to frustrating administrative tasks do the following:
      <ol class="content">
        <li>Delegate to group members</li>
        <li>Implement consistent processes</li>
        <li>Encourage and reward quality membership</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <p>Delegation is key for numerous reasons. Have you ever been part of a group with low engagement? Usually its due to individuals not feeling a “part” of the group. Delegations solves this problem. If group members have tasks they are responsible for, they feel more engaged. Additionally, if the burden for all the administrative tasks fall on one person, the chance of burn out for that one person (and subsequently the entire group) is high. Avoid this position by implementing our key #1 to group management.</p>

      <p>There are many ways of handling the administrative tasks. Commonly, groups conduct processes in inconsistencies manners. For example, to collect attendance, they might use paper sign in sheets one day and an excel spreadsheet the next day. This causes confusion. What is the standard method for collecting attendance?  The last thing you want is confused group members. Avoid this position by picking a solution for each administrative task and sticking with it.</p>

      <p>Key number #3 is obvious: Encourage and reward quality membership (duh). But it is much easier said then done. To do it effectively you must focus on incentives and value creation. This providing real value to members for certain actions that are you important to the group. To implement this effectively you must think about incentives that translate to real value. Think about your group. How do this apply? Don’t just say you are rewarding and encouraging quality membership, do it effectively by being thoughtful in your approach.</p>

      <p><b>Remember:</b> Group management can be easy if you follow the short list outlined above!</p>
